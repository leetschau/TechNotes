------

After version 1.4.0, ranger add a command "yp" to copy full path name of a file with xsel. So you have to install xsel (apt-get install xsel), then use middle-button of the mouse to paste it somewhere else (both console and GUI apps, and if you are using laptop, you can only paste to console with `xsel -o`). Because xsel is a "global clipboard", you can use yp of ranger in one console, and get the path with middle button or `xsel -o` in another console.

 

 

Note: see man page of xsel for the concept of 3 different clipboard PRIMARY, SECONDARY and CLIPBOARD of X windows.
