------

Find the "release" file and print its content:

    $ ls -ld /etc/*release
    $ cat ... # the *-release file

This is valid for most Linux distros, such as CentOS, Debian, Gentoo, Fedora, Ubuntu, Mint ...

Or get the information from the login screen:

    $ cat /etc/issue

For Debian family distros, like Ubuntu, Mint:

    $ ls -ld /etc/*version
    $ cat ...

The final solution is lsb command, but not all distros support it.

    $ lsb_release -a
