* Mandatory authenticaion: login as Administrator, Settings -> Authentication -> Check "Authentication required", set "Autologin" as "disabled";

* Hide Bitnami landing page: modify the <body> of file $REDMINE_HOME/apache2/htdocs/index.html as:

    <!DOCTYPE  ...>
    <html>
        <body onLoad = "parent.location = 'http://123.124.236.183/redmine/'">
            Redirection ...
        </body>
    </html>

  Modify "parent.location" as your redmine location.

* Modify Web UI font size: /opt/redmine-2.4.3-0/apps/redmine/htdocs/public/stylesheets/application.css, the 2nd line:

    body { ... font-size: ... }

# Add Email Notification

Edit file: /opt/redmine-2.4.3-0/apps/redmine/htdocs/config/configuration.yml

    # default configuration options for all environments
    default:
      # Outgoing emails configuration (see examples above)
      email_delivery:
       delivery_method: :smtp
       smtp_settings:
         
         address: 123.124.236.199

         authentication: :login
         user_name: lichao1@boco.com.cn

Change host path as Administrator: [Administration -> Settings -> General -> Host name and path: 123.../redmine]
Note there is no "http://" before the string and no "/" after it, too.
