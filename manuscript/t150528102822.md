------

Comparing with shadowsocks, [sshuttle](https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle) is
a much lightweight, open source alternative.
All you need is a ssh server outside GFW.

The installation is just `git clone` its repository on github.

To use it, only run a command on client: `./sshuttle --dns -r user@sshServer 0/0`.
Here option "--dns" is necessary to avoid DNS pollution inside GFW.
Add "-v" or "-vv" option ONLY for debug purpose, for it decreases connecting speed a lot.
"-r" means "remote", so add your remote host outside GFW after it.
The last part of this command specifies which connections on client to use
by this proxy, "0/0" means all connections, which is the most common case.

For convenience, add
`alias sv="$HOME/apps/sshuttle/sshuttle --dns -r user@sshServer 0/0"`
into ~/.bash_aliases.

Now you can use `sv` to start the vpn, Ctrl-C to stop it.
