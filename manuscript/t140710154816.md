# Install

Ref: [Octopress Setup](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/).

    curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
    rvm install 1.9.3
    rvm use 1.9.3
    rvm rubygems latest
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.13.1/install.sh | bash      // install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
    echo "source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
    nvm install 0.10
    nvm use 0.10
    cd ~/apps
    git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
    cd octopress
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    rake install

Note1: Do NOT use ruby 2.1.1, it can't install bundler, while ruby 2.1.2 is OK.

Note2: Ruby 1.9.3 in pre-installed on Ubuntu 14.04. An "Permission denied" error occurs when `gem install bundler`.
  You have to `rvm install 2.1.2` to build a non-root ruby environment to install bundler.

Note3: `bundle install` is very slow. If it's stuck when installing some components, cancel it with Ctrl-C and rerun this command.

# Usage

## Setup

1. Create a new repo named "<username>.github.io" on [GitHub](https://github.com/);

1. Build blog website framework:

        rake setup_github_pages

    When asked, provide the url (https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io) of above repo.

## Configuration

Modify _config.yml to customize blog's title, subtitle, author and blog descriptions.

Under "3rd Party Settings", set "github_user" as "<username>".

## Post new blog

Run the following command to create a new post, and edit post content:

    rake new_post["Hello World"]
    vi source/_posts/2014-08-18-hello-world.markdown

## Preview blog website

Run the following command to generate new post and preview them:

    rake generate
    rake watch    // optional
    rake preview

If it complains no javascript rumtime found, run `nvm use 0.10`, where version number "0.10" is determined by `nvm list`. Now preview with url "http://localhost:4000".

## Deploy to Github

Run generate and deploy tasks:

    rake generate

If it complains no javascript rumtime found, run `nvm use 0.10`.

    rake deploy

You need provide username (without @gmail.com) and password of your github account.

Sometimes when you encounter an error when `rake deploy`,
it said there are confliction in your github.io repository,
and you have to resolve the confliction by `git pull`.

Go to $APP_HOME/octopress/_deploy and run:

    git pull origin master
    git add -A
    git ci -m "merge conflict manually"

Now go to $APP_HOME/octopress and run `rake deploy` again.
Your blogs will be synchronized to github.

There are many other [Static site generators](http://www.mzlinux.org/?q=node/415). Some based on Python such as [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) looks lighter than Octopress.
