# Open file at cursor

* Open in the same window: gf

* Open in a new window: <C-w>f

* Open in a new tab: <C-w>gf

You can use relative path. For example, when you put cursor on any character of "dir1/file1" and press gf, the file "file1" under folder "dir1" in CWD will be opened.

# Jump back from "gf"

* Jump back: <C-o> or :bf

* Jump back and forth between two files: <C-6>
