------

If your termianl can't display UTF-8 character correctly, check the following:

1. If this terminal is set to display UTF-8 character?

    $ echo -e '\xe2\x82\xac'
    â‚¬

If the euro sign can't be displayed, then ssh to this host via another host which can display UTF-8 character, and run this command remotely via ssh. If the euro sign displayed, it's verified your terminal do not support UTF-8, you have to install another UTF-8 supported terminal.

Ref: "My terminal doesn't support UTF-8" in [Locale](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/locale) of ArchLinux Documentation.

Otherwise it's the case of your settings.

# Ubuntu

List all locales installed on the system:

    $ locale -a

Test result:

    $ LC_ALL=en_US.utf-8   // notice LC_ALL=en_US can't display UTF-8 charaters correctly!

Enable it permanently: add "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" or "LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8" into /etc/default/locale, and refresh it:

    $ sudo locale-gen

# Arch Linux

    $ sudo pacman -Syu vim  // install vim and xxd

# Convert file encodings

    $ iconv -l | GBK
    $ iconv -l | UTF-8
    $ iconv -f gbk -t utf-8 <filename>
