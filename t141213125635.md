------

Show current network status of the computer: `nmcli c status`, `nmcli nm` and `nmcli d`;

List all available Wi-Fi access points: `nmcli dev wifi`;

Connect to a new (unconnected before) access point:
`nmcli dev wifi con "My SSID Name" password MyPassword iface wlan0 `,
or use default interface: `nmcli dev wifi connect MySSIDName password MyPassword`,
replace "wlan0", "My ESSID Name" and "MyPassword" with yours.

Turn off current connected wifi: `nmcli nm wifi off`.

Next time when connected this wifi, turn on with `nmcli nm wifi on`.

Other unverified versions:

    nmcli d wifi connect <WiFi-ESSID> password <WiFi-Password> iface wlan0
    iwconfig wlan0 essid <WiFi-ESSID> key <WiFi-Password>

Note:

`iwlist wlan0 scan|grep ESSID` only list the connected Wifi, instead of all available Wi-Fi access points.

Ref:

`man nmcli`;
