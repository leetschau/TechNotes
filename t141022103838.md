# LinuxMint

If you login in terminal,
add the following line into ~/.xinitrc before "exec i3":

    xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1"

If you login with Xfce GUI,
add above line into ~/.xsessionrc.

If you want to change to right-hand style mouse buton,
run the following command in console:

    xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3"
