1. Run `apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra`,
(logout and login again if the following steps failed);

1. In dash (use Win key), input 'compiz', run 'CompizConfig Settings Manager";

1. Click `Window Management`, then click `Put`;

1. In `Put window`, check `Enable Put`;

1. Click the `Disable` button at the right side of `Put to Next Output`
(with a keyboard icon), set `Alt-Shift-u`;

That's it. Now use `Alt-Shift-u` to move window between screens :)
