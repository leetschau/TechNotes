Calibre has stand-alone ebook viewer "ebook-viewer", start it in terminal:

    $ ebook-viewer <filename>

The only downside of this app is the long startup time.

I also tried view mobi file with okular on Linux Mint 14 Xfce.
But its KDE mobi plugin "kdegraphics-mobipocket" doesn't work.

Okular on Ubuntu 14.04 works better than evince.
It supports j/k to move page.
Toggle any UI components in [main menu -> Settings]. (updated in 2016.2.5)
