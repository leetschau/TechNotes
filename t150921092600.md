------

You've cloned a repo from remote host into foler "$HOME/docs/myapp".
So you can't use `meteor create myapp` to build a new Meteor app.

You can create this "myapp" under /tmp,
and `cp -r /tmp/myapp/.meteor $HOME/docs/myapp/`.

Now open $HOME/docs/myapp in Webstorm,
it's been a Meteor app already.
