In vim doc, use `Ctrl-]` to jump to the tag under the cursor,
use `Ctrl-o` to jump back.

For example, run `:h airline` (you must have installed vim-airline,
see note "Customize Vim Statusline" for details).

Put the cursor on "airline-customization" in section "CONTENTS",
press `Ctrl-]` to jump to section "CUSTOMIZATION",
press `Ctrl-o` to jump back to section "CONTENTS".
