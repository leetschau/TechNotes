Termianl, a.k.a. console or command line, is a great tool to tell computers what to do. It's efficient and cool to type some words in a terminal(of course in full screen mode) and get all things done. But if you have only one terminal on the screen, switching between directories are always disturbing and time-consuming jobs. So to keyboard fans, a terminal enhancement tool is necessary. With the help of workspace(a.k.a. virtual desktop) switching tool and window arrangements shortcuts, a geek's screen is like this:

 

1. Put all GUI windows in workspace 1;

 

1. Put terminal windows in workspace 2;

 

1. In workspace 2, switch multiple terminal tool in full screen mode;

 

1. Use workspace switching shortcuts to switching between GUI workspace and terminal workspace;

 

# Windows: Conemu + VirtuaWin

 

Terminal full screen: alt + enter;

 

Split window: alt + h/v (split horizontal/vertical, defined in [Settings-> Keys & Macros -> duplicate active <<shell>> split to bottom/right]);

 

Switch between terminal: [ctrl + tab] or [Win + q];

 

Hide tab bar: Settings -> Features -> Tabs -> Don't show;

 

Switch workspace: alt + win + Left/Right/Up/Down (defined in Setup -> Hotkeys of VirtuaWin);

 

# Ubuntu: Teminator

 

Auto run command when startup (ssh to a remote server in this case): terminator -x ssh bvt@10.0.2.74;

(use terminator -h for details. xterm and konsole also surppot -e <command> syntax).

 

Terminal full screen: F11 (defined in [System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Windows -> Toggle fullscreen mode]);

 

Split window: alt + h/v (split horizontal/vertical, defined in [Preference -> Keybindings -> split_horiz/split_vert]);

 

Switch between terminal: alt + Left/Right/Up/Down;

 

Toggle Window max/normal of one of all terminals: ctrl + shift + z (defined in [Preferences -> Keybindings -> scaled_zoom]);

 

Make background transparent: [Preferences -> Profiles -> defaults -> Background -> Transparent background: 0.8];

 

copy on selection: [Preferences -> Profiles -> Copy on selection];

 

Switch workspace: alt + ctrl + Left/Right/Up/Down (defined in [System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Navigation -> Move to workspace left/right/above/below]);
