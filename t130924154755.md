------

[Evil](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil) is vi mode in emacs. 

* Use "y" to copy text into system clipboard and paste them somewhere else, vice versa. 

* Use :bd to kill buffer, much faster than <<C-x k RET>>;

* Use :q to leave Emacs, much faster than C-x C-c; Be careful to use these 2 commands for they providing no confirmaiton for modifications of buffers;
