I want convert my resume file (markdown files) to pdf files. On Linux system, I use pandoc to convert md files to html: 

    # apt-get install pandoc
    $ pandoc myresume.md -f markdown -t html -s -o resume.html

or simply "pandoc myresume.md -s -o resume.html", the "-s" option is necessary, or Chinese characters will be massed up.

The personal information section (name, address, email, mobiles, etc) is left-aligned, while they should be centered. However there isn't "centering" format in markdown, so I have to add this format  manually in created html files:

    $ vi resume.html
    // add "<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>" before the centering section
    // add "</DIV>" after the centering section

Then convert the html files to pdf, there several ways to achieve this:

# MS Office Word

Copy contents of html file generated last step, paste it into a blank word file, centering personal information, modify margin, font (consolas is good) and other layout elements, such as adding page break before section title, etc.
Then save it as PDF format (if using Word 2007, you have to install the pdf plugin of MS Word).

# wkhtmltopdf

The wkhtmltopdf can't convert hyperlinks in html to pdf files properly. So this is not a valid options.

# Texlive for Pandoc

    # apt-get install texlive   // this package maybe is huge, 281MB to download
    # apt-get install texlive-xetex lmodern etoolbox
    $ pandoc MyResume.md -o Resume.pdf --latex-engine=xelatex -V mainfont='WenQuanYi Micro Hei'

Get all installed fonts with `fc-list` on Linux Mint.

Note1: If there no Unicode characters (such as Chinese characters) in the markdown file, use 'DejaVu Sans Mono' instead of WenQuanYi, much better than the latter.

Note2: `pandoc myresume.md -s -o test1.pdf` met "Error producing PDF from TeX source.  ! Package inputenc Error..." on Linux Mint 17, i3wm.

Note3: The page margin of the default pdf file is too large. Don't know how to set margin yet.
